This C++ project creates a database of electrical engineering students at the University of Nairobi. The database allows for the following operations:

Adding new students: The secretary can input the student's information, including registration number, name, gender, email, and phone number.
Removing students: The secretary can delete existing student records.
Sorting students: The database can be sorted alphabetically by the student's name.
Key Features:

Linked List Implementation: The project utilizes a linked list data structure to efficiently store and manage student information.
User-Friendly Interface: A simple and intuitive interface allows for easy data entry and manipulation.
Robust Data Management: Ensures data integrity and prevents accidental deletion or modification.
How to Use:

Compile the code: Use a C++ compiler (e.g., g++) to compile the project's source code.
Run the executable: Execute the compiled program to start the database application.
Perform operations: Use the provided commands or menu options to add, remove, and sort students.
Additional Notes:

The registration number serves as the unique identifier for each student.
The database provides a clear and organized view of student information, making it easy for the secretary to manage the data.
