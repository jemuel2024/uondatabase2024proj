        "Once I've heard a phrase: if you want to comprehend something, teach it...so here I am almost finishing this tutorial about Object-Oriented Programming and put my hands on the next one. Data Science and machine learning fields are undoubtedly extensive and I am like you always learn something new day after day. From my perspective, OOP in Data Science isn't obligatory and you can benefit a lot with many different libraries (e.g. Scikit Learn / Keras and so forth). However, knowing OOP will give you more opportunities and flexibility in your feature projects. With the help of OOP, you will better understand relationships between objects and classes, concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation and polymorphism. Besides, frameworks such as PyTorch or Tensorflow will force you to face with OOP anyway.\n",
        "\n",
        "I know, it may sound terrifying but only at first sight. This tutorial isn't going to be short because I like details. They are really important. For this purpose, don't be lazy, experiment with your code and test yourself. These are probably secrete ingredients for successful learning. Alright, enough talking and let's have a look at what we are going to cover.\n",

Imagine that you are developing a plot function and you want to control whether or not to display a legend, confidence intervals of a graph or a plot type. For this purpose, you define parameters or let's name them triggers depending on which you switch the behaviour of the function (e.g. we can define the following parameters: show legend = True, show_conf_intervals = True. Switching these parameters to True/False will lead to changing the function behaviour, exactly what we want). That's probably all we need to know about methods overloading.\n",
